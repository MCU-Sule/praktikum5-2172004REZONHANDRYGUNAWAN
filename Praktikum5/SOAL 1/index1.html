                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. <br>
                 <p class="big" align = center> <span style="text-decoration-line: line-through;">CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</span> </p>    
            </p>

            <p><li style="text-align: center;">
               CSS is designed to enable the separation of <br>
               presentation and content, including layout, colors, <br> 
               and fonts. This separation can improve content <br>
               accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in <br> 
               the specification of presentation characteristics, <br>
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by <br>
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file <br>
                which reduces complexity and repetition in the <br>
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to <br> 
                be cached to improve the page load speed between <br>
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in <br>
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech- <br>
                    based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for <br>
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. <br>
